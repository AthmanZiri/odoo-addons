In some data integrations scenarios, you have API access to the ORM, but
limited to the ``create()`` and ``write()`` methods.
It's the case for Pentaho PDI/Kettle and Talend Data Integration.


This module provides a workaround to import data using the ``load()`` method:
``create`` calls on the ``import-loader`` model fire ``load`` operations on
the desired models.

Note: this module evolved from ``import_sqlpush``, available for 6.1 and is
intended to be used as a replacement technique for it.
